# Preface {-}

A collection of various quotes and text segments gathered through the course of my life from various sources.
You will notice that I have split the quotes to some basic categories.
For some of these I also briefly discuss their context or state my personal opinion with regard to why I found them important to remember in the first place.
So, interesting material overall!

Feel free to browse the collection :)
