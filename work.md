> Taking handwritten notes (which is a slower practice than typing) forces you to encode/summarize the knowledge in your own words and that process of recoding promotes long-term attention.

*Andrew Ng*, from an [interview](https://youtu.be/0jspaMLxBig) with Lex Fridman.

He nicely summarized the results of some studies on why taking handwritten notes is actually good for attention and understanding compared to typing verbatim what you hear.

> The case for my life, then, or for that of any one else who has been a mathematician in the same sense which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that these somethings have a value which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have left some kind of memorial behind them.

*G.H. Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology*

This resonates so much with me (I put it in my PhD thesis as well :)
The **care and value of the work** is measured in kind not degree.

> Remember, things take time.

*Piet Hein*, Danish polymath.

> My biggest pet peeve about the fitness culture is motherfuckers making excusses!
Biggest excuse is that they don't have time.

*CT Fletcher, Shit Talking Saturdays Vol. 2, [see video](https://youtu.be/W0t48EngZ4w?t=152)*

This applies to any person really who justs finds excuses to cover for his inability to get down and do the **work**.
I myself, have a hard time dealing with these (as CT calls them), *excuse-making* motherfuckers!

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

*Richard Feynman*

This was a nice argument for the *openWorm* project: we have to create a digital model of an organism in order to be able to say that we fully understand it (i.e. explain its behaviour).
A small step also towards making a digital human (avatar).

> If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it.

*Richard Feynman*

This should be the most prolific quote for science communication.
A lot of people do nice work in general, but if you cannot explain it in another (intelligent human) being, then what is the purpose?
How can you show your passion to others about what you are doing without being able to express it in relative simple terms (language)?

> Paul Erdös — well known for his hyperactivity and his habit of working 19-hour 
days, even well into his old age; and his tendency to show up on his colleagues' 
doorsteps demanding they "open their minds" to mathematical dialogue — was one 
of the most prolific mathematicians who ever lived, publishing more 
peer-reviewed papers than any other mathematician in history.  
His secret? According to him, amphetamines. Included here is an excerpt from a 
book published in 1998 by Erdös' de factobiographer, science writer Paul Hoffman, 
which explains Erdös' proclivity for amphetamine use:  
Like all of Erdös's friends, [fellow mathematician Ronald Graham] was concerned 
about his drug-taking. In 1979, Graham bet Erdös $500 that he couldn't stop 
taking amphetamines for a month. Erdös accepted the challenge, and went cold 
turkey for thirty days. After Graham paid up — and wrote the $500 off as a 
business expense — Erdös said, "You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't 
get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. 
I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. **You've set mathematics back a 
month.**" He promptly resumed taking pills, and mathematics was the better for it.

*Paul Erdös*

> To my wife Anne, without whose silence this book would never have been written.

*P. K. Dick, The Man in the High Castle*

I really wonder what his wife said about that!

> One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that 
one’s work is terribly important.

*Bertrand Russell*

> As for the quality of the work, it is the same as ever with me in any work - 
in the midst of it one thinks it well done, sometimes even very good, but as 
soon as a little time passes, you see how almost completely unsuitable is 
really is and how it would be better to change everything, even though I don't 
how to do it any better.

*Rachmaninoff to Morozov (letter), July 6, 1905)*

Case is with music composition but it applies to computer programming and
others as well.

> As usual I work a lot and as usual everything comes to me in an extremely                         hard way...

*Rachmaninoff to Morozov (letter)*

> After writing about 20 R packages, I found I had accumulated several utility 
functions that I used across different packages, so I decided to extract them 
into a separate package. Previously I had been using the evil triple-colon ::: 
to access these internal utility functions. Now with xfun, these functions have 
been exported, and more importantly, documented. It should be better to use them 
**under the sun instead of in the dark**.
