You will notice that I have split the quotes to some basic categories. For some of these I also briefly discuss their context or state my personal opinion with regard to why I found them important to remember in the first place. So, interesting material overall! Feel free to browse the collection :) "],["general.html", "General", " General Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. Parkison’s Law Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Murphy’s Law A man got to be what he is Joey. Can’t break the mold. From Shane (1953). Shane teeling Joey he can’t stay. Has to move on. Any treasure you attain without anyone ever working, is no treasure at all. Chief Nyanta, Log Horizon The trick to being a scientist is to be open to using a wide variety of tools Leo Breiman, from the paper Statistical modeling: The two cultures (2001) I didn’t receive any email. Not sure how that might have happened, but electrons are small and easy to lose sometimes. Will Murray It’s been real. It’s been good. It ain’t been real good. From Obama and Luther’s Farewell Address - Key &amp; Peele The nature of promises is that they stay immune to changing circumstances. Kevin Spacey as Francis Underwood in House of Cards To create is to limit oneself. Alexander Scriabin The objects created via our imagination can take abstract representations in our world throught various forms of art, e.g. music, painting, poems, movies, etc. Note though, that these are only approximations of the originals and as such, no matter how best the art form represents the mental images/stories/configurations, they can never hope to match them (and as such, they limit them considerably). Head clear. Mouth shut. See much. Say little. Roland Deschain, The Dark Tower V Summarizes one of my stronger beliefs in how to manage most life-situations as strategically as possible: when you don’t know, it’s best to just shut up and pay attention. Period. Long days, pleasant nights Roland Deschain, The Dark Tower I No particular clever comment on this one, but it’s a really nice phrase to use! ‘The world has moved on,’ we say… we’ve always said. But it’s moving on faster now. Something has happened to time. It’s softening. Roland Deschain, The Dark Tower I Such elegant choice of words that create a mysterious yet nice feeling! Is Time really softening in our world today? Who is to say?! Trial of Humanity: The Defense rests. Sensui, Yu Yu Hakusho This phrase brings up scenes from wars, etc. - so many people have fallen for the stupidity of war and wrong ideals. I also kinda feel that I use this phrase when there is nothing more I can do or say to change a situation that has already happened. I defended as best as I could my opinion/position/whatever. Now I have to rest and it’s something that every human goes through (the trial). It’s feels truly unescapable. Maybe we are not alone and have not been. “The click beetles in my backyard don’t notice that they’re surrounded by intelligent beings — namely my neighbors and me, but we’re here, nonetheless.” Seth Shostak Regarding the Fermi paradox, from an astronomer at the SETI institute. He thinks that the answer to the Fermi paradox might lie not in something complex, like time and distance, but in perception. History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it Winston Churchill Big man, big words. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it George Santayana True that. You should never accept money you feel you haven’t earned. If you do, you’ll start to always take the easy way out… Anyway, no good ever comes out of drowning in wealth or power. Arataka Reigen, Mob Psycho You are a sceptic! Never! What are you? To define is to limit! Lord Henry Wotton, from the “Picture of Dorian Grey” More of an epigram than a quote! When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad. And that is my religion. Abraham Lincoln Nice quote on altruism. Go ahead, show me what you’ve got. But so you know, I’m not expecting much. Saitama to Monster King Orochi, One Punch Man This is what one feels (without actually saying it) when he is a master at something and someone else comes and acts more knowledgable/better/stronger. It can be generalized against anything, e.g. life: show me what you got, I don’t expect too much though! (meaning that whatever life throws at me, it is not going to change how I act) Put people in the same room Martin Kuiper, Professor of Systems Biology From -10 to +10, going to Mc Donald’s, drinking mocha Frappuccino. Asmund Flobak, Oncologist &amp; Researcher Asmund summarized here my state of mind at a certain point during my PhD. It’s actually a deeper quote than it sounds: it refers to these periods in someone’s life where you have such good and bad moments at the same time, everything seems so far away from normal, average days. If you think about it in a systems dynamics sort-of way, it’s like living during a chaotic life-phase with many oscillations You go into a river once (You can’t step into the same river twice!) Asmund Flobak, Oncologist &amp; Researcher My take on this: don’t do things twice, don’t repeat mistakes, etc. "],["johns-quotes.html", "John’s Quotes", " John’s Quotes &ldquo;Push forward and hard.&rdquo; John Zobolas Trim that string.

Do you suppose I have no troubles, never hesitate and lose confidence in myself? Do you really think faith is always equally strong? All of us have difficult moments; but this is life. Hold up your head, and keep on your appointed path.” Leo Tolstoy to Rachmaninoff Rachmaninoff was in a depressed state of mind and hadn’t composed anything during that period. These words should had help him get up on his feet, but work was just what Rachmaninoff was unable to do at that time. Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm Winston Churchill Common pattern. Wins are hard gained (no pain, no gain philosophy).

But my chief objection is on other grounds. ”It makes listening to music too comfortable. You often hear people say, ‘Why should I pay for an uncomfortable seat at a concert when I can stay at home and smoke my pipe and put my feet up and be perfectly comfortable?’ “I believe one shouldn’t be too comfortable when listening to really great music. To appreciate good music, one must be mentally alert and emotionally receptive. You can’t be that when you are sitting at home with your feet on a chair. ”No, listening to music is more strenuous than that. Music is like poetry; it is a passion and a problem. You can’t enjoy and understand it merely by sitting still and letting it soak into your ears.\" Rachmaninoff (from an interview in Paris, 1928) Something that I also realized later in life: it’s good to know that many share the same opinion. “The poet Heine once said, ‘What life takes away, music restores.’ He would not be moved to say this if he could hear the music of today. For the most part it gives nothing. Music should bring relief. It should rehabilitate minds and souls, and modern music does not do this. If we are to have great music we must return to the fundamentals which made the music of the past great. Music cannot be just color and rhythm; it must reveal the emotions of the heart.” Rachmaninoff (from an interview for The New York Times, 1932) What is music!? How can one define it? Music is a calm moonlight night, a rustling of summer foliage. Music is the distant peal of bells at eventide! Music is born only in the heart and it appeals only to the heart; it is Love! The sister of Music is Poesy, and its mother is Sorrow! Rachmanoninoff (1932) His value and power as a pianist and conductor reside in his imagination, in his inner perception of the original musical image. HIs performance is always creative, always as if the composer were playing it - and always as if it were “for the first time”. He seems to be improvising, making a song not heard before… Medtner to Rachmaninoff (1933) One of the most important qualitites of piano playing: whenever you play something that someone else wrote, play it like its the first time, like an improvisation. I believe this is what distinguishes really good classical music piano players. "],["talent-vs-genius.html", "Talent vs Genius?", " Talent vs Genius? No amount of genius can overcome obsession with detail. Anonymous Cannot be more true than that! “Can an ordinary person imagine things the way you do?” “You ask me if an ordinary person, by studying hard, would get to be able to imagine these things, like I imagine. Of course! I was an ordinary person who had studied hard. There are no miracle people. It just happen they got interested in these things and they learned all these stuffs. There are just people. There’s no talent, special, miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practicing and reading and learning and studying, so if you say it take an ordinary person who’s willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking in mathematics, then he has become a scientist.” Richard Feynman I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious. Albert Einstein If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results. Newton Doing easily what others find difficult is talent; doing what is impossible for talent is genius. Henri Frederic Amiel “I am inclined to believe that heredity and training are inseparable and indispensable in any ART achievement. I consider that a capacity for hard work is also a Talent, and only those few artists who have inherited both musical and working talents attain the highest peak of their profession.” Rachmaninoff (1937) "]]
